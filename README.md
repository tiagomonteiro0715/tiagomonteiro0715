<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>
<p>I am Tiago Monteiro, currently finishing my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NOVA School of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>My interests lie in control theory, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on solving complex problems through advanced applied mathematics.</p>

<p>I am a Silicon Valley Fellowship fellow in the Winter 2025 batch, an experience that allows me to engage with leading entrepreneurs, investors, and industry experts in Silicon Valley and San Fransisco.</p>

<p>To gain insights into financial strategy and decision-making for startups, I completed IESE Business School's Think Like a CFO program and Yale University's Financial Markets course.</p>

<p>I develop trading strategies employing advanced statistical methods and deep learning architectures, consistently outperforming the S&P 500. Utilizing QuantConnect, a quantitative trading platform with over $2 billion in monthly trading volume, I design, build, and test strategies in Python.</p>

<p>As an IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) PT Officer, I create promotional videos for IEEE's initiatives and activities. IEEE is the largest global nonprofit professional organization focused on advancing technology for humanity's benefit.</p>

<p>As a previous Vice Chair of the IEEE NOVA Student Branch, I represented IEEE at the student level and organized numerous successful events, including one that gathered over 50 students to discuss master‚Äôs thesis management.</p>

<p>I possess three AI specializations from Coursera: Andrew Ng's Deep Learning and MLOps, and the University of Alberta's Reinforcement Learning. Additionally, I completed an Agile Project Management workshop at NTT DATA in Lisbon.</p>

<p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I engage in community service. My volunteer work includes assisting at election polling sites and supporting the efforts of the neighborhood food bank.</p>

<p>I have demonstrated my language proficiency through an IELTS score of 7.5 and by obtaining a C1 Advanced Cambridge English certificate.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I contribute as a writer for FreeCodeCamp, where my published articles have garnered more than 175,000 views.</p>

<p>I am eager to explore joint ventures and prospects in the fields of artificial intelligence, trading, and control systems research.</p>
