<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>
I am Tiago Monteiro, currently a master of AI at Northeastern University in the Silicon Valley campus.

I finished my undergraduate degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering at NOVA University, one of the best universities in Portugal.

NOVA University is known worldwide for some of the best data science (NOVA IMS) and business (NOVA SBE) master's degree programs in Europe and the world.

My interests lie in control theory, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on solving complex problems by applying advanced mathematics.

I am a Silicon Valley Fellowship fellow in the Winter 2025 batch, a program that allowed me to learn with leading entrepreneurs, investors, and industry experts in Silicon Valley.

To gain insights into financial strategy and decision-making for startups, I completed IESE Business School's Think Like a CFO program and Yale University's Financial Markets course.

In addition, I completed the specialization Quantum Mechanics for Engineers Specialization from the University of Colorado Boulder. 

This way, giving me a foundation to understand where all forces of the university come from, current physics challenges like quantum gravity, and solutions like string theory.

Also, to give a firm foundation to quantum AI and quantum computing.

As a previous IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) PT Officer, I created 20 promotional videos for IEEE's initiatives and activities. IEEE is the largest global nonprofit professional organization focused on advancing technology for humanity's benefit.

As a former vice chair of the IEEE NOVA Student Branch, I represented IEEE at the student level and organized several successful events, including one that gathered over 50 students to discuss master‚Äôs thesis management.

I completed three AI specializations from Coursera: Andrew Ng's Deep Learning and MLOps, and the University of Alberta's Reinforcement Learning. 

Furthermore, I completed an Agile Project Management workshop at NTT DATA in Lisbon.

I have demonstrated my language proficiency through an IELTS score of 7.5 and by obtaining a C1 Advanced Cambridge English certificate. 

In addition, I contribute as a writer for FreeCodeCamp, where my published articles have garnered more than 230,000 views. 

I am eager to explore joint ventures and prospects in the fields of artificial intelligence, and control systems research.
