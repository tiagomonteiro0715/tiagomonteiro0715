<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>

I'm Tiago Monteiro, a finalist in the Electrical and Computer Engineering bachelor's program at NOVA School of Science and Technology. I have a strong interest in control theory, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, and I enjoy tackling challenging problems that involve advanced applied mathematics.

I am the founder of **EuroStatify AI**, an AI startup leveraging Google’s open-source large language models (LLMs) to simplify research for law creation and to serve anyone interested in legal, economic, and social statistics in the European Union.

To deepen my understanding of financial strategy and decision-making for startups, I completed the Think Like a CFO program from **IESE Business School**. I also create trading strategies using advanced statistical methods and deep learning architectures, having successfully beaten the S&P 500 through platforms like **QuantConnect**.

As an **IEEE PT Officer**, I create videos promoting IEEE's initiatives and activities. I’ve also served as Vice Chair of the IEEE NOVA Student Branch, where I organized impactful events like master's thesis discussions with over 50 students.

Additionally, I hold certifications in **Deep Learning** and **MLOps** by Andrew Ng, and **Reinforcement Learning** by the University of Alberta, along with an **Agile Project Management workshop** completed at the NTT DATA office in Lisbon.

Beyond academics, I am a blogger for **FreeCodeCamp**, with articles garnering over 175,000 views. I also volunteer at polling stations during elections and collaborate with the local food bank.
